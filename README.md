#### 2. Pricing Strategy
• Competitive Pricing: Set the price of CodeX slightly lower than market leaders to attract new customers, especially in the competitive youth market. Consider a price range that balances profitability with accessibility, potentially around ₹60-₹80 per can, depending on local market conditions.

#### 3. Marketing Campaigns
• Influencer Partnerships: Collaborate with fitness influencers, gamers, and lifestyle bloggers who resonate with your target audience. This can enhance brand visibility and credibility.
#### 4. Brand Ambassador Selection
• Athletes and Fitness Icons: recruiting well-known athletes or fitness trainers as brand ambassadors will assist in the visibility of Codex. Their endorsement can align CodeX with the sports and exercise aspects that resonate with respondents, enhancing the brand’s reputation and appeal.

• Local Influencers: Identify popular local figures in key cities (Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Chennai, Pune) who embody the brand values and can connect with the youth demographic.
#### 5. Target Audience
• Youth and Fitness Enthusiasts should be focused on: Continue targeting the 19-30 age group, especially those involved in sports, fitness, or intense study habits. This demographic has shown a strong preference for energy drinks for specific activities like sports and late-night study sessions.
